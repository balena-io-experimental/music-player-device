# Music Player

This project is a [Resin.io][resin]-supercharged project for playing a playlist on Resin-supported devices, each of which are synchronised to each other.

The project currently uses [Grooveshark][grooveshark] to stream music specified in a separate [frontend application][frontend-code].

We currently host the frontend on GitHub Pages - [frontend][frontend-pages], this is hooked up to a [Firebase][firebase] backend. This will be customisable soon.

The project is in major development at the moment so don't expect stable behaviour just yet :)
